This is a prediction league using Nodejs and MySQL. It could be used for any sports events(Cricket - (IPL, Big Bash, ICC Events), Football). 
Any registered user can take part and predict the outcome of each matches. Each prediction has a scoring criteria and accordingly after end of each match the scores are calculated.
At the end of the tournament the player with the highest score wins it.

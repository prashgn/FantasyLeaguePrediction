This is a rule based prediction league, which could be used for any sports events(Cricket - IPL, Big Bash, Football). 
Any registered user can take part and predict the outcome of each matches. Each prediction has a scoring criteria and accordingly after end of each match the scores are calculated.
At the end of the tournament the player with the highest score wins it.

I would like to thank Tarandeep Singh and Mayur Malgundkar for being part of team. We had used Nodejs and MySQL.
It was a wonderful learning experience.
